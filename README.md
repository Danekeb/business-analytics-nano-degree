In this project, I analyzed data from the New York Stock Exchange(NYSE)

After completing the lessons and the project, I feel comfortable with:

Identify different datatypes to determine what analyses are possible.

Calculate measures of center and spread to describe quantitative data.

Use a variety of spreadsheet functionality to gain insights from data.

Build charts and graphs to communicate the results of your analysis.

Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then
answering those questions.

Analyze a future dataset using Excel.
